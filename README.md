Boris Bikes
======

From about week 3 of Makers, driven from tutorial, introducing us to object oriented programming via classes in Ruby, and further methods in RSpec. 

It's a bunch of interacting classes without a unifying program, so to play with it, go to the lib directory in irb, and require 'boris_bikes'.
